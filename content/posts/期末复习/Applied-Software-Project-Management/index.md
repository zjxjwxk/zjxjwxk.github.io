# General characteristics of a project

A project is a temporary endeavour undertaken to create a unique product or service. It is specific, timely, usually multidisciplinary, and always conflict ridden. Projects are parts of overall programs and may be broken down into tasks, subtasks, and further if desired.

- Vary in size
- Vary in type
- Have desired completion dates
- Requires various kinds of knowledge
- Requires domain knowledge
- Requires team work
- Requires responsibilities and authorities
- Do not exist in isolation

# General management vs. Project management

- General management
  - Organizational management
  - Portfolio management
  - Program management
  - Not time limited?
  - No completion dates?
  - No managerial hierarchy?
  - Routine activities
  - Annual budgeting
- Project management
  - Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirements

# Five categories of activities

- Initiating
- Planning
- Executing
- Monitoring and Controlling
- Closing

# How does the world look like?

- Uncertainty
- Plans go awry
- Even the closest future is unpredictable
- Chance events occur frequently
- The life is a rough road
- We need to do trade-offs every day
- We constantly negotiate
- We need flexibility

# Risk management

- “Project management is risk management”
- Identify potential problems before they occur
- Put preventive actions in place before unrecoverable harm occurs


## Risks 
- possible events that may affect the project negatively

## Problems
- events that have or will affect the project negatively
## Stages in risk management:
  - Risk identification; project, product and business risks
  - Risk analysis; probability and consequences, triggers
  - Risk planning; how to address risks – eliminate, reduce, ignore
  - Risk monitoring; controlling and updating the risks

# Gantt chart

![Strategic Plan for New Business](images/1548144904444.png)



# RACI matrix

- Usually derived from the WBS
- Clarify responsibilities
## R
- Responsible, who is responsible for actually doing the activity
## A
- Accountable, who is accountable for the completion of the task
## C
- Consult, who should be consulted
## I
- Informed, who must be informed
- Note that combinations may exist, e.g. AR, CI, AC
- Example

  ![RACI Model](images/1548142487683.png)

# Critical path

- A path from the projects start event to its finish event that, if delayed, will delay the completion date

![Critical path1](images/1548143653742.png)

![Critical path2](images/1548144057724.png)

# Brainstorming

![Brainstorming](images/1548142617388.png)

# Sprint, Sprint backlog

## Sprint
- A fixed period of time, usually 2 or 3 weeks but can be more
- Always use the same fixed period
- The development team should have full authority during the sprint
- The Sprint goal must be defined in advance
- The team can change (the depth of) the functionality of the Sprint, as long as it meets its sprint goal

  ![Sprint](images/1548155535982.png)



# Product backlog

- Requirements gathering for the Product Backlog
  - Identify the stakeholders and their goals
    - Identify the different categories of stakeholders
    - Ask the question: “Why do you need this?”
    - What are the business objectives and goals?
    - How do we measure goal accomplishment?
    - The goals shall be SMART:
      - Specific
      - Measurable
      - Acceptable
      - Realistic
      - Time-based
  - Gather requirements for the Product Backlog
    - Meet the stakeholders
    - Understand the stakeholders needs
    - Use the “Tree and Forest” analogy
      - Identify the trees, branches and leaves
      - Use a top down approach mixed with bottom-up?
      - The leaves may be user stories
      - Group the leaves into branches
      - Group the branches into trees
      - Verify the stories with the stakeholders
    - The CUTFIT rules Validate the user stories
      - Consistent no conflict between user stories
      - Unambiguous one interpretation
      - Testable test cases can be created
      - Feasible possible to implement
      - Independent independent of other user stories
      - Traceable you can link the story to the project goals
- Do not write stories endlessly. You can stop when you cannot decompose anymore or when you can derive tasks with working effort of approximately one day
- Product Backlog Item (PBI), example

![Product Backlog Item](images/1548060857834.png)

- Scrum board

![Scrum board](images/1548060911632.png)

- Some thoughts about the Backlog
  - Scrum in action recommends items to be stories (branches)
  - Frequently, in practice, it seems to be a mix of stories, features, functions, tasks, improvements and incidents
  - If you choose stories, you should consider defining tasks (leaves) in the stories
  - The tasks should be transferred to activities in the sprint planning



# Burndown charts & EVM method

## Earned Value Method - EVM

![Negative schedule, negative cost](images/1548170614674.png)
![Positive schedule, negative cost](images/1548170969127.png)
![Negative schedule, positive cost](images/1548170999918.png)
![Positive schedule, positive cost](images/1548171236485.png)

## Trend projection - EV

![Trend projection2](images/1548172040323.png)

## Agile and Scrum tracking

- Release tracking
  - Tracking story progress
  - Release burndown chart
- Sprint tracking
  - Tracking task progress
  - Sprint burndown chart

![Release burndown chart1](images/1548172373109.png)

![Release burndown chart2](images/1548172438304.png)

![Release burndown chart3](images/1548172594127.png)

## Burndown charts
- Displays the **remaining** effort for a given period of time
- Do have good value for the stakeholders and the team
- Visualization is a good thing to do
- Conversation starters
- Over time it will give you the average number of points for a sprint
- You will learn the teams velocity
- You need to have a clear definition of done (DoD)

## Sprint burndown chart
- Burndown charts
  - X axis displays working days
  - Y axis displays remaining effort
  - Ideal effort is (may be) a good guideline
  - Consists of real progress of effort

![Put # of hours (story points) at the Y axis](images/1548172874084.png)

# Scrum team
- Why is Scrum effective?
  - Systematic reduction of problems and risks
  - A leaner software development cycle
  - More adaptive process
  - People´s motivation and pride are in focus

# Monitoring and Controlling
- Determine the current status of the project schedule
- Influencing the factors that create schedule changes
- Determining if the project schedule has changed
- Managing the actual changes as they occur

## Monitoring
- All parties, stakeholders and others, must have available the information required to exercise control over the project
- An effective information system is needed
- Automated and manual
- Collection, recording and reporting project information
- Activities and performance need to be monitored

## Controlling
- Uses monitored data and information to bring actual performance into agreement with the plan
- Do we have the right information?
- How shall we interpret the information?
- How to balance into decisions?
- Without control there would be confusion, scope risks and conflict among stakeholders
- Chaos could be the norm of the project
- Monitoring and Controlling are easily treated together

![Monitoring and Control](images/1548165068217.png)

## Execute plan - Design the monitoring system
- Identify characteristics of scope, time and cost
- Identify the goals, the objectives
- Define the boundaries when do we need to take action?
  - Thresholds.
- Monitor progress against the sub-goals (e.g. milestones, sprint goals)
- Define data gathering mechanisms
- Define communication plan
- Measure activities, but always measure against RESULTS
- Define the system before-hand, up front

## Obtain results
- Decide on the data format
  - Frequency, e.g. occurrence of event
  - Raw numbers, actual amount
  - Subjective numeric ratings, estimates, ranking
  - Indicators, indirect measures
  - Verbal characterization, team spirit, soft issues, feelings
- Collect data
  - Decide on how to collect the defined data. More easily and preferably automated.

## Analyse results
- Analyse BEFORE reporting
- Simple aggregation can be done
- Compare with the planned results
- Averages, summaries, medians, trends
- Examples
  - Number of activities done/left
  - Actual cost/remaining cost
  - Number of bugs per unit
  - Performance or velocity
- You should use data for discovering, and as input for decision making

## Identify variance and Analyse results
- Identify deviations from the plan
- Variances can lead to severe problems
- The goal is to identify variances as early as possible
- Use plots, bars, lines, dots, etc. for analyzing trends (more later)
- Compare the variances towards the planned (allowed) variances

## Variances
- Acceptable – continue to monitor
- Unacceptable – additional action is required
  - Consult personnel
  - Consult expertise
  - Could it generate more problems?
  - Any additional risks?
  - Call for meeting, analyze in groups

## Identify root cause and consider options
- Do not immediately adopt the first identified solution
- Try to find the optimal solution
- Analyse side-effects to the different solutions
- Resources needed?
- Cost?
- Time?
- Need help/decisions from sponsor/stakeholders?

## Corrective action and implementation
- Decide on corrective actions
  - Review options
  - Define success measures if possible
  - Make choices of actions
  - Who decide?
- Implement
  - How will it be implemented?
  - By whom? When?
  - Who is responsible?

## Analyse the results
- Analyse the results of the corrective actions
- Compare against the defined measurements
- If unacceptable result then go to root cause analysis (again)
- If acceptable close the problem and store into lessons learned
- Repository of Lessons Learned: Take care of your Best Practices
- Avoid the situation from re-occurring

## Reporting
- Different kinds of reports
  - Status reports
  - Progress reports
  - Forecast report
  - Time/Cost report
  - Variance report
  - Presentations
  - Demos

# SWOT analysis

![SWOT](images/1548056696215.png)

- **Strengths and Weaknesses**

  - Human factors
  - Finances
  - Organisational factors
  - Physical resources
  - Experiences and knowledge
- **Opportunities and Threats**
  - Trends
  - New research
  - Funding
  - Competitors
  - Competence
  - Channels (marketing)
- **SWOT analysis**
  - Prioritize elements in the analysis
  - Define possible activities
  - Analyse if it is feasible
  - Decide on further management and activities
  - Close down strategic direction if found
  - necessary
  - Keep the SWOT-analysis continuously updated
  - Focus on the prioritized elements

# Stakeholder Management

- **Definition** of the term stakeholder:
  - An individual
  - A group
  - An organisation
  - who may affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by a decision, activity, or outcome of a project.
  - Project governance the alignment of the project stakeholders´ needs or objectives
- Stakeholder can be
  - The sponsor, the one who provides the resources and support
  - Customers and users persons or organisations that will approve and manage the project´s product, service or result.
  - Sellers provides components or services necessary for the project
  - Business partners provides special expertise, e.g. installation, training, support.
- Example
  - Organizational groups internal groups affected by the project activities
  - Functional managers human resource, financial, accounting, procurement, IT
  - Other stakeholders government experts, subject matter experts, consultants,

# Project Cost estimation

- Budgeting the project
  - Must (always) be approved by management
  - Resources must be allocated based on the estimations
  - Should be connected to the vision and goals
  - Should be supporting to the portfolio and program management
  - Upper management is always (?) relating the project success to its relation to the approved budget
- Budgeting the project, necessities
  - Shall always be related to the stakeholder requirements
  - You need to have an idea of which resources you have
  - Correct data must be collected
  - Timely reporting
  - Strong focus on resource and cost predictions
  - Confirm approval of changes
  - Consider always changed cost predictions when decisions are taken
  - Consider changed cost predictions when problems occur
  - Estimate changed cost predictions if risks become problems
- Forecasting
  - What resources will be needed?
  - How much resources will be needed?
  - When will they be needed?
  - How much will the resources cost?
- The resource cost can be differentiated by
  - Unit, role
  - Individual, level of competence or salary
- Need to consider
  - Unit (hours, days, weeks, money,…)
  - Level of precision (round up or down)
  - Level of accuracy (range)
  - Links to backlog and stories
  - Threshold (agreed variations, if any)
  - Performance measurement (earned value or story points left)
- Cost estimation tools and techniques
  1. Expert judgment
  2. Analogous estimation
  3. Parametric estimation
  4. Top-Down estimating
  5. Bottom-Up estimating
  6. Three-Point estimating
  7. Group-decision techniques
  8. Wide-band Delphi technique

# User story & story points

- User story
  - A story is a feature a bit of functionality with some characteristics (non-functional characteristics)
  - Keep the stories simple and as short as possible
  - A story is an agreement between the customer and the supplier
  - It must provide some value to the customer
  - Stories should be independent of each other
  - Stories must be testable
- Examples
  - As a power user, I can specify files or folders to backup based on file size, date created and date modified.
  - As a user, I can indicate folders not to backup so that my backup drive isn't filled up with things I don't need saved.
  - As a consumer, I want shopping cart functionality to easily purchase items online.

# Agile and Scrum

  - Scrum start the game over again.
  - Was originally launched as a contrast to plan-driven development
  - The goal is: To produce software more effectively
  - Embrace change
  - Embrace change quickly!
  - The change towards agile is not easy
  - You need to have the organization with you
