## Know the elements
Communication, Analysis, Synthesis, Valuing, Execution
## Know the definition
**Communication**: Identifying the gap
**Analysis**: Thinking about alternatives
**Synthesis**: Creating likely alternatives
**Valuing**: Prioritizing alternatives
**Execution**: Taking action to narrow the gap

**Communication**:
• Become aware of the gap
• Discomfort, not so much fear of change
• Seek assistance if needed
• Emotions
**Analysis**:
• Clarify your knowledge
• Clarify gap

• Reduce to a manageable amount of options.
• Brainstorm and reduce.
**Valuing**:
• Judge the benefit (and cost)
• Rank
• What´s the best choice?
• Select an option
**Execution**:

# The typical team, as defined by Brown

- Designers
- Managers
- Subject Matter Experts
- Stakeholders

# The three values of the glue of a team

- Respect
- Humility
- Empathy

# Be able to distinguish between assignment and commitment

## Assignments
### Assignments should be commitments
### Pressure to deliver
### Requirements to perform
- The expected result
- The expected cost
- Within the expected time frame
- Normally, these three items are pushed to its limits
## Commitment
- Should be voluntarily
- Deadlines, delivery dates should be defined
- Should be specific, clearly defined
- Clearly motivated
- Admit problems and risks
- Practice commitment culture

# Mindset defined (Perception, Attitude, Disposition)

## Perception
– How to interpret thing
## Attitude
– How to react
## Disposition
– Decide course of action, what to do

# Different mindsets

# Active listening

## Active listening
- Understanding
- Acknowledge
- Encourage
- Elaborate
- Hear others ideas
- See others ideas

# Types of listening

## Prepare

– Get ready

## Pause

– Give time for speaking

## Probe

– Let people elaborate

## Paraphrase/re-phrase

– Summarize

– Repeat

– Confirm

# Three obstacles to listening

- Short-circuiting
- Closed doors
- Embattled egos

# Browns definition of conflict

Conflict is the way teams come to a shared understanding of each decision made in the process

# Origins to conflicts

• Differences in objectives
• Different opinions
• Different values
• Argumentation and friction are unavoidable
• Negotiations with the customer
• Argumentation within the project organization
• Different or changed priorities

# Positive consequences of conflicts

- Produces better ideas
- Forces people to search for new approaches
- Causes problems to surface
- Forces clarification
- Stimulates interest and creativity
- An opportunity for people to test capacities

# Shared understanding

# Obstacles to shared understanding

- Unclear goals
- Unclear process, directions
- Unknown constraints
- Personal disagreements
- Misconception
- Ego
- Disinterest

# Healthy and unhealthy conflicts

## Unhealthy conflict
### A mask for
– Not understanding
– Not knowing
– Anxiety for the decision
– Personal conflicts

# Root causes to conflicts

## External
### Four types of tensions
– Disconnectedness
– Exclusion
– Misdirection
– Ambiguity
## Internal
### Method conflict
– Different ways of interpreting the method – HOW things are to be done
– Different criteria for success
– Re-do things
– Adapt and tailor the method
– Could be hidden by an outcome conflict
– Usually it is healthy, it progresses work
### Outcome conflict
– “The content of a decision”
– Product outcomes – how the product look like
– Poor performance – how to work
– How to structure (Plan) the project
– Purpose conflict – Why is this done?
– Lack of decisions, lack of clarity

# Know the five principles of behaviour patterns

1. There is no single right answer
2. Patterns may introduce new approaches
3. Not every pattern works in every situation
4. Several patterns may give the same result
5. Patterns that are experienced as comfortable may be your favourite patterns

# The four types of patterns to solve root causes of conflicts
## Empathize
	– Break down misunderstandings – shared understanding
	– Let a neutral person take notes
## Involve
	– To get more involvement
	– Story telling. Could use neutral persons
## Redirect
	– Find focus, narrow the scope, take baby steps
## Reframe
	– Use different words, find other approaches

# The definition of collaboration

• Collaboration means “working together” according to the dictionary
• In software projects it also includes “producing something”

# Collaboration vs. Groupthink

## Collaboration
- Working together

## Groupthink
- When you agree rather than come up with something better

Collaboration should lead to groupthink

# Aspects of collaboration

## Tools
### The tools have different focus
Tools helps in sharing and collaboration
Software tools for
– Messages
– Chats
– Video

## Mindset

### Perception
– How to interpret thing
### Attitude
– How to react
### Disposition
– Decide course of action, what to do

## Culture

  • Open workspaces or closed rooms?
  • Dislike in some way of communicating
  • Against or for face-to-face communication
  • Organizational limitations and boundaries
  • Competition between people
  • Heading for a promotion?

# The four virtues of collaboration
1. Clarity and Definition
2. Accountability and Ownership
3. Awareness and Respect
4. Openness and Honesty

| Irrelevant (无关紧要的)comparisons                           | “Have you   seen this Web site?”                             | someone   contributes comparative examples with little or no practical relevance to the   design problem | consider micro/macro perspectives;   help me prioritize指出哪里相关;   communicate implications |
| Lack of clear inputs                                         | “Mmm...   yeah... we’re not going to have the budget to do user research.” | Designers   don’t have detailed inputs (requirements, starting points, etc.) to frame the   problem and inform the solution. | Make a plan;   Make it real;   Make assumptions              |
| Lack of   context                                            | “There’s a   lot going on behind the scenes here...”         | Teams do not   have insight into the organizational, business, or operational context   surrounding a project. | Pick one thing;   Help me help you;   List assumptions       |
| Lack of decision maker                                       | “So, what   does the group think?”                           | Design   decisions drag out because no authority is capable of rendering executive   decisions when necessary. | anticipate agendas;   hold a workshop;   communicate implications |
| Lack of stable strategy                                      | “So, things   have changed since we last spoke...”           | the project’s   objectives, parameters, or constraints change regularly. | make assumption一些原则;   blame a “bad cop”制定deadline;   treat it like a project |
| Late-breaking   requirements                                 | “Now that I   think about it, we’re also going to need...”   | the   stakeholder who didn’t have time to participate in the process; the one thing   that one guy   forgot; a   change to the business that has a ripple effect throughout all the company’s   systems. | Help me prioritize;   make it real;   make a plan            |
| Misinterpretation of tone                                    | “Your email   was really snippy.”                            | breeds hostility(敌意) or disrespect   in the   communications. | Change the channel;   reflect the position;   come back later |
| New perspectives                                             | “I know I’m   coming in with this late, but...”              | stakeholders offering new perspectives may not welcome   their positions being hastily dismissed.(立场被驳回) | assert your process;   frame the conversation(和利益相关者建立谈话);   offer alternatives（提供更多的选择） |
| No plan                                                      | “OK, so what   do we do next?”                               | In this   situation, the project lacks a plan that defines desired outcomes,   activities, schedule, and assignments. | Blame a “bad cop”;   draw pictures;   offer alternatives     |
| No time to   design                                          | “Just get   some rough ideas down by tomorrow, OK?”          | Forces   outside the design team establish an unreasonable schedule for producing   design ideas | assert your process(坚持自己，说完不成);   help me help you;   set reasonable expectations |
| Not a team   player   拒绝和别人合作                         | “I can take   care of this.”                                 | Someone on   the team refuses to engage with other members   | Ask for help;   Go back to basic;   communicate implications |
| Overpreparation认为已经解决了问题                            | “I think we’ve   got the solution already.”                  | Product   teams may create early mock-ups to frame the problem, which locks them into a   particular way of thinking about the   problem. | Hold a workshop;   ask questions;   ask for a story          |
| Poorly   composed feedback                                   | “That just   doesn’t look right to me.”                      | The team   receives feedback that doesn’t clearly articulate the next steps, the desired   improvements, or the issues with the current   version. | Frame the conversation;   take baby steps(go through the   design point by point);   change the metaphor |
| Poorly   planned presentation or discussion                  | “I hate to   put you on the spot, but...”                    | Project   stakeholders do not understand the design work because the design team hasn’t   assembled a meaningful narrative | set reasonable expectations;   assert your process;   ask questions |
| Reluctant   participation in design activities   (一些人不积极参与design) | “I’ll leave   the drawing to my colleagues.”                 | Some members   of the team may not actively participate in creative games and brainstorming   activities. | provide starting points;   assert your process;   communicate implications |
| Responses   not timely                                       | “[This quote   intentionally left blank.]”                   |                                                              | provide starting points;   assert your process;   communicate implications(和25pattern一样) |
| Separated   from key stakeholders                            | “Let me take   this to the VP, and I’ll let you know what she says.” | Designers   find themselves separated from the true client or customer through layers of   bureaucracy. | Hold a workshop;   assert your process;   take baby steps    |
| Tasks and   goals not aligned                                | “Everyone   says we need to hold a daylong brainstorming session.” | Designers   sometimes engage in design activities with no real rationale. Such activities   yield outcomes that likely don’t move the   project   forward, or do so inefficiently. | set expectations;   ask for the first step;   make a plan    |
| Uncoordinated   collaboration                                | “So, which   one of us is doing this?”(分配任务)             | Some project   teams have no plan, no overall direction of where they’re going long-term and   the activities required to get there. | Take responsibility;   provide starting points;   enumerate issues |
| Unfounded   design direction（毫无根据的设计方向）           | “Hey, I did   some mock-ups!”                                | Someone   outside the design team prepares screen designs, concepts, or other artifacts   attempting to establish a creative direction.   When a   non-designer shows up with design artifacts, the team may feel tension   because it implies lack of performance from the   designers. | Ask questions;   take responsibility;   acknowledge achievements |
| Unreasonable   constraints                                   | “I want the   design to look the same on every Web browser.” | Designers   thrive on constraints: boundaries help designers understand what constitutes   a good solution for the challenge. Some   projects,   however, are bounded by constraints that are arbitrary. | consider micro/macro perspectives;   help me prioritize;   make it real |
| Wrong scope                                                  | “What do you   mean I wasn’t supposed to work on that?”      | A designer   works on the wrong thing.                       | Take responsibility;   acknowledge achievements;   Go back to basics |



| pattern                                              |                                                              |                                                              |                                                              |

| Acknowledge achievements（involve                    | “Wow, you   guys did a great job on this. I can see the effort you put in. Can you walk   me through to make sure I understand   everything?” |                                                              | Engaging with someone   about his or her work, and potentially balancing achievements with   opportunities for improvement. |
| Anticipate agendas（empathize                        | “I know   there are a few things that are especially important to you, so I wanted to   address them right away.” | Imagine what’s   important to other members of the team or project stakeholders before   engaging in a discussion with them. | Entering a   conversation with people expected to be competitive or confrontational, to   demonstrate that you have their best   interest in mind. |
| ask for a story（reframe                             |                                                              | Ask someone   to describe their ideas or thoughts or needs in the form of a story. | Someone   struggles to articulate their needs in the abstract, and you want to help   them make it more concrete. |
| ask for help（involve                                |                                                              | Directly ask   someone to help you with your task.           | You need   help. You’re preoccupied with proving yourself instead of solving the design   problem. |
| ask for the first step(Reframe)                      |                                                              | Ask someone   what their first step will be in attempting to achieve an objective. | Someone   struggles to articulate their process for performing a task, by getting them   to focus only on a small slice. |
| ask questions(Reframe,Involve)                       |                                                              | Instead of   jumping to conclusions, ask questions to make sure both you and the other people   understand what’s going on. | All. The.   Time. No other skill is as essential to designers as being able to ask good   questions. Except, perhaps, listening to   the answers. |
| assert your process(redirect)                        |                                                              | Remind   participants of the schedule and the process on which it is based, providing   lots of detail about activities, outcomes, and goals. | Someone   introduces factors that may compromise or derail the process, like late-breaking   requirements. |
| Blame a “bad cop”(reframe)                           |                                                              | Use another   team member (not present) as a scapegoat. By putting a human face on the   situation, people might work harder to find a   compromise,   or might forgive ignorance. | Facing   unreasonable constraints or being put on the spot for a question you can’t   answer immediately. |
| Call their bluff(揭发底牌) reframe                   |                                                              | Take a   challenge to its inevitable conclusion and hold everyone involved accountable   for meeting the challenge. Help other team   members   understand the impact of their request. | Presented   with unreasonable requests that aim to put pressure on the design team   without any meaningful outcome. |
| Capture   lessons learned（involve，redirect）       |                                                              | Make a list   of issues, obstacles, and difficulties that came out of a prior project or   situation or challenge. | The project   team hasn’t taken a moment to reflect on their previous work and how they   could have done it better. |
| change the channel（email，voice，etc）（reframe     |                                                              | Find a   different “channel” in which to communicate. Sometimes this means moving from   email to voice, or in person to email, or   instant   messenger to video chat. Sometimes this means taking a conversation out of a   public venue. | The medium   of communications is impacting participants’ ability to express themselves   clearly. |
| Change the   metaphor（reframe）                     |                                                              | Use a   different concept to explore or explain a complex idea. | Participants   become fixated on the metaphor and not the problem being solved, or when   participants need a new way of   looking at   the same old problem. |
